Come meet us at Engineering Immersion! This is a great opportunity to see what we're all about. Hear about the work we do, programs we run, and speak to current members about their experiences on the team! We love getting to meet new people and answer questions, so don't hesitate to stop by and say hi! Herbst Plaza is the open area just below the Engineering Center. For any questions, please email <a href="mailto:ewb.cu.chapter@gmail.com">ewb.cu.chapter@gmail.com</a>.
