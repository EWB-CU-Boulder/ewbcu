EWB CU has just begun working in Ecuador as of 2024! We are starting a new water project in San Antonio de Bashalan, Ecuador, by implementing new distribution piping, a water treatment system, and improvements to the existing water storage tank in a community of about 250 residents.

Accessing the community is difficult during the rainy season due to road damage, and they have faced water scarcity for some time which has only been exacerbated by aging infrastructure. Now, we are excited to announce that the community assembly has decided to work with us in developing a comprehensive plan to improve their water system!

Previously, the team worked in Caserio Totolyá, a community of 110 families located just south of Lake Atitlán in the middle of Guatemalan coffee country. A landslide triggered by Hurricane Stan wiped out their previous settlement, and EWB-USA Guatemala determined in 2018 that the community's existing water pipeline was in need of serious upgrades to improve water access and avoid high risk situations for the residents. Over the course of five years, EWB CU constructed four aerial crossings over large ravines, improved the community's water distribution system, installed an automated pumping system, and stabilized landslide-prone areas.
