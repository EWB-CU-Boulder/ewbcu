</div>

Since 2007, the EWB Nepal team has worked with a local Nepali NGO, the Namsaling Community Development Centre to design and implement water, sanitation, and hygiene engineering projects including water distribution systems and spring source protection projects in partnership with local communities. Our project is currently with the Hattitar village in the Ilam district of East Nepal to design and build a spring source protection project and water distribution system to deliver clean and reliable water to each household in the community. Our process includes rigorous professional engineering review and a thorough maintenance and evaluation of project functionality.

Students can get involved with the Nepal program by contributing to the design, sustainability, communications, or fundraising components of each project, whether it is spring source protection or establishing strong connections with our collaborators and future community.

In January of 2024, we established our first sister chapter partnership with EWB-Nepal Pulchowk campus! We are so excited to start working with them in our mission to strengthen international engineering communities.
