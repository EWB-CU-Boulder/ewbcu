about:
    title: "About Us"
    text: "Engineers Without Borders-USA was founded in 2002 at the University of Colorado Boulder by Professor Bernard 
    Amadei after visiting a friend's village in San Pablo, Belize, which was in desperate need of clean water. \"I knew
    that as a civil engineer, there had to be something I could do,\" Dr. Amadei reflects, thus marking the beginning of 
    EWB-USA. With the goal of creating positive change for communities worldwide, EWB-USA has since grown from eight CU 
    students to over 12,000 students and professionals across the United States. The CU chapter continues to be active and
    currently leads four ongoing projects."
