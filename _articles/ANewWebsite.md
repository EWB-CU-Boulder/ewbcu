Hey y'all!

Glad to see you made it here :D As you are (hopefully) able to tell, EWB CU officially has a new website! We will now be giving updates from this one, so make sure to check back regularly.

As the site is very new and we're still getting the hang of everything, we would love your feedback! To report bugs or give suggestions, please email us as <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>, though we hope it's already (mostly) perfect for y'all ;D

Thank you all so much; now let's go get some work done!

-your valiant global geek, Caleb
