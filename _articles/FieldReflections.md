This past summer, EWB CU's Nepal project implemented the final phase of their 5-year long project in Hattitar. As they finish up and start to look ahead towards future projects, we wanted to share some of the team's thoughts and reflections from working in-country:

<b><i>In your experience of the culture, project, community relationship, etc., what went well, what didn't go well, and what might you do differently going forward?</i></b> 

Sascha: In my experience, the community had an incredible amount of buy-in, excitement, and appreciation for our work together and for their community. I think that overall, I made many friends with community members that I talked with today and enjoyed my interactions with them. I was able to be accepted into the community for a short time and there were many tears when we left.  I think that communication could be improved, especially by encouraging community members to give their input on the overall design. That being said, I think there was a fine line for their buy-in versus stopping them from making decisions which would negatively impact construction. I think that this line is very fine, and it would have been appreciated to get more input from others on how to work within these situations.  

Cayden: First, everyone in the community was incredibly open, kind, and curious. The team formed genuine relationships with our homestay families and had a lot of fun working. This was an effective work trip, but also a genuinely incredible cultural experience. I was not as well educated in certain things as I would have wished. I had a basic understanding of Nepali and had learned about a few customs from other team members, but not how people dealt with food, or especially women’s rights. For example I was surprised by the fact that so many young women worked on the digging team, where many of the young men went to high school in Ilam. There were counterexamples. Our homestay mother is very active advocating and participating in NCDC. But generally women had less freedoms than men. This dichotomy is different from my lived experience (coming from a suburban community in Colorado). It is something I wish I had been more aware of before I went.

<b><i>What have you learned about yourself and/or your community partner and how have your values, opinions, beliefs of yours have changed through this experience?</i></b> 

Sascha: I think that I have learned that I can be the lead on a large project and ensure the success of a project within the field. Overall, I felt really excited by the positive progress of the project and many of my own beliefs and values have been more encouraged by working with community members.  

Cayden: Confidence is one major thing. My experience began from a lower basis than other team members. I had to face up to my doubts and deal with asking questions and accept that I was making an impact. This is best summarized by understanding that even if I feel like I’m failing (or not feeling I know enough) I'm working towards something positive when I work with the team for a common goal. 

<b><i>What specific knowledge and skills did you gain through your experience?</i></b> 

Sascha: I received more experience within cross cultural communication and being able to communicate with the community clearly and with an open mind. I also gained skills within construction and how to manage a large project across our community.  

Cayden: Skills included things ranging from basic exposure to plumbing hardware, through to nonverbal communication across a language barrier. I learned how to use GPS for surveying, its limitations and data systems. Because did not take responsibility for any one part of the system, I did sort of float around; but this meant I was a sort of liaison, and gained insight into the structure of how an engineering project ran. GANTT charts and scheduling skills are something I have only started being exposed to. I also gained a beginning skill in communication without, or with only a limited, common language. Maybe this is ‘common sense’, but I certainly did not have it in the beginning, and I started learning by the end.

<b><i>How did this experience impact you? What did you gain personally and professionally?</i></b> 

Sascha: As a person, I gained more of an open mind on what rural communities in Nepal might look like and how this impacts their daily life/what is needed for them to flourish and have healthy lives. I was able to gain an appreciation for the culture and the amount of work that NGOs put into place. Professionally, I think this gave me a lot of information for my next steps forward and what I would like my career to look like.  

Cayden: It’s made my view of engineering much more focused around actually helping people. I understand that we need to focus our changes directly around community needs, preferences, and skills, not just apply expectations or pieces of paper.

<b><i>What impact did the experience have on the community, what did they learn or gain from this experience?</i></b> 

Sascha: Many community members were able to gain experience with masonry and plumbing. They were excited to learn from the contractor on site and were able to gain many skills that they are able to put towards their own livelihoods. Additionally, I think that due to my and the other women who participated in the work, many female members of the community felt empowered to have a say within the system and the amount of work that we put in. As a result, I think this really helped a lot of young people in the community see what they might be able to accomplish if they continue with their education and possible avenues that they could help the community.  

Cayden: The community worked incredibly hard to achieve the goal of clean water flowing to every household. They have the payoff of five years of cooperation, and hopefully will have stable water access for the future. They also had the opportunity to work together on a relatively large-scale engineering project, and this certainly opened their horizons; Hopefully younger members will take this as an empowering experience, understanding how valuable engineering and education can be.
